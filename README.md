See [outputs](https://csusbdt.github.io/happy_birthday/) for the mp3 files generated by this project.

__happy_birthday_note__ I used this as a first step by representing 
the Happy Birthday song in code.

__test_sinc__ I used this as a second step to test my Sinc class.

__happy_birthday_1__ I used this as a third step to generate 
my first version of Happy Birthday using sinc notes.

__happy_birthday_2__ I used this as a fourth step to generate 
my second version of Happy Birthday using sinc notes.

__happy_birthday_1_432__ I used this to generate a version of happy birthday 1 using the
traditional tuning where A is 432 Hz.

__happy_birthday_2_432__ I used this to generate a version of happy birthday 2 using the
traditional tuning where A is 432 Hz.

I first built this project with mingw, then with cygwin.

I looked at https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~myers/howto/g++compiling.txt
to remember how to compile C++.

To compile under cygwin, I cloned this repo with the following.

    git clone --config core.autocrlf=false git@github.com:csusbdt/happy_birthday.git
