__happy_birthday_note__ I used this as a first step by representing 
the Happy Birthday song in code.

__test_sinc__ I used this as a second step to test my Sinc class.

__happy_birthday_1__ I used this as a third step to generate 
my first version of Happy Birthday using sinc notes.

__happy_birthday_2__ I used this as a fourth step to generate 
my second version of Happy Birthday using sinc notes.

I built this project with mingw.

I looked at https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~myers/howto/g++compiling.txt
to remember how to compile C++.
